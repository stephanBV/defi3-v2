npx create-react-app defi3
cd defi3

truffle init
truffle-config.js:
    --> added: contracts_build_directory: "src/contracts",
    --> changed compiler to ">=0.8.7"
    --> development port 8545

npm i @openzeppelin/contracts
npm install web3

open Ganache Desktop --> workspace w/ RPC Server on port 8545

npm i @truffle/contract
npm i @metamask/detect-provider
created utils/ in src --> added load-contract.js

-terminal 1: npm start
-terminal 2: truffle compile then truffle migrate

npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap@5.1.3

error: <method> is not a function
solution found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67628607/contract-set-is-not-a-function
--> I created the contract with truffle which does not behave like web3
--> you don't call function the same way

receipt does not fire if using Ganache 

you get receipt from tx (send) without any returned values from the smart contract
for view function only call will return the value

value={inputVale || ''} --> needed to uncontrolled to controlled state

delete yarn.lock because we already have package-lock.json which cause redendency when deploying
